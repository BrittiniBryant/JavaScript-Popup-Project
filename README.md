# JavaScript-Popup-Project
A pop up that will trigger once the user tries to navigate away from the page.

In order to demo this yourself, download the files, double click the "index.html" file. 
Then move your cursor away from the page (like trying to create a new tab).
The popup will trigger. 
If you input the wrong format for an email address, you will get an error message.
If you input correct format, you will be taken to a "Thank you" message and it will disappear after 3 seconds.
If you click "Not Interested" or the big red X button, the modal will close.
